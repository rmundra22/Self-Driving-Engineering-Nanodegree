# Self-Driving-Engineering-Nanodegree
Working to build a Self-Driving Car a reality!

## Part 1 Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

> I'll be applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. I will create modules to teach car how to perceive world by detecting lane lines, predicting steering angle, and more all based on camera sensor data, point-sensor data etc.

## Part 2 Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

> I'll expand on my sensor knowledge to localize and control the vehicle. I'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle, finishing by combining all my learned skills on a real self-driving car!
