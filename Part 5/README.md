## Optional Resources

   > To complete the project, you only need the files in the github repo; however, we are also providing some extra resources that you can use to develop your solution:

    - A Sensor Fusion utilities repo (https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) containing Matlab scripts that will generate more sample data (generating your own sample data is completely optional)
    - A visualization package that you can also find within the Sensor Fusion utilities repo
